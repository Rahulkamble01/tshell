# To deploy your application on server

### Update database changes in the server
This section is applicable only if there is any change required in the database. 
For example, it can be for creation of new tables, new columns, remove columns, etc.
If there are these kind of structural changes then ensure that you have a new 
.sql file available in tshell/db folder with appropriate numbering. The following 
steps will tell how to make necessary changes to the server database.

1. For our example, we will use the following file from db folder:   
   `002_tShell_alter_user_for_forgot_password.sql`
2. Open WinSCP to transfer the sql file.
3. On right hand side open folder `/home/729721` 
4. On left hand side open folder `d:\tshell-project\tshell\db\002_tShell_alter_user_for_forgot_password.sql`
5. Drag and drop this sql script on right hand side opened folder.
6. Login into `10.142.194.149` using putty.
7. Login with your credentials
8. Open mysql client, `mysql -u root -p` and password as `mysqlCT5`.
9. Execute following commands:  
   `use tshell;`
   `set autocommit=0`
   `source /home/[Employee Id]/002_tShell_alter_user_for_forgot_password.sql`
10. Check the execution log and ensure that there are not errors. If there are errors  
    execute the `rollback;` command and correct the sql file and try executing again.
11. If there are not errors then execute the `commit` command.

### To deploy service part of tShell project
To deploy restful webservice, we need to create WAR and then transfer to server.
1. In eclipse, right click on tshell project:   
   Export -> Export... -> WAR file -> Destination as `D:\tshell-service.war`
2. Open 10.142.194.149 using WinSCP.
3. Login with your credentials.
4. In the left hand side open D: folder.
5. On right hand side open folder `/opt/tomcat9/webapps` .
6. Drag and drop WAR file from left hand side to right hand side.

### To deploy Your Angular Part
Create a production distribution folder and transfer the contents of this folder to server.
1. In Visual Studio Code terminal window execute below command to create dist folder:
   `ng build --prod --base-href /tshell/` 
2. Open 10.142.194.149 using WinSCP.exe
3. On right hand side go to `/opt/tomcat9/webapps/tshell` folder and remove the existing files and folder.
4. Now go on left hand side in `D:\tshell-project\tShell\ui\tshell\dist` folder.  
5. Select all the files and folders.
